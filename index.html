        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello At UPES, Dehradun, I'm Omi Kumari, a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree. I'm passionate about technology and all of its possibilities. I've enjoyed exploring the field of engineering and learning something new every day since I first started my adventure here. I've always found the workings of things fascinating, particularly when it comes to technology and computers. I've been eager to absorb as much information as I can, from discovering complex concepts to mastering the fundamentals of coding. Now that I'm in my second year, I think I'm beginning to understand the intricacies of the subject, and it's really fulfilling. In addition to my studies, I enjoy being active on campus.I think I should make the most of my college experience, whether that means hanging out with friends, volunteering for events, or joining clubs. It's not only about learning; it's also about developing yourself and creating lifelong memories. I'm ready to keep learning and developing and am thrilled about what the future has in store. I'm aware that every obstacle I overcome brings me one step closer to realising my dreams and changing the world.</p>
